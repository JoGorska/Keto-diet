# Keto Diet
## Aim of the website
I hope to explain what Keto diet is about and show how effective and pleasurable it can be. I aim to encourage more people to try it. I am not a dietitian, but I have read a lot about Keto. I am on Keto 7 months and I want to share me experience. 

## Structure of the website

1. Results, what I have acheved being on Keto Diet
2. How it works - Recipe for success
3. Authorities - people that speak about Keto
4. How to start on Keto
5. Keto flu
6. Am I in Keto - how to measure if you are in Ketosis
7. Suplements
8. Contact page - leave your contact details for dietitian to get back to you

## Additional ideas for the website

1. Add your Keto recipe - form for users to add their recipe

3. Links to websites or youtube videos on Keto
